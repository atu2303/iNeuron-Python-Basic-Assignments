    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans : less coding, error reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "Ans : variable defined outside function are under global scopes and variable defined inside function comes under local scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans : The local variable can be used outside the function any time after the function call completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "Ans : \"return\" return results of that function. Yes \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "Ans : A function without an  return statement returns None . In the case of no arguments and no return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "Ans : A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "Ans : NoneType\n",

    "Ans : use try clause\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "Ans : part of code that could cause error go into try clause, the code which should execute even after error should go in except clause.\n",
